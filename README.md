## Version
https://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.37.tar.bz2

## Before you start
Change the timezone in the Dockerfile if you like

## Building the image
You can build the docker image by running:
```
make build
```

To start the image, simply run:
```
make start
```

## Connect to the container
```docker exec -it ns3 bash```

## Testing the image
To make sure that it works, in the container run:

1. ``` cd ns-allinone-3.37/ns-3.37/ ```
2. ``` cp examples/tutorial/second.cc scratch/ ```
3. ``` ./ns3 scratch/second   ```

Expected output:

```
